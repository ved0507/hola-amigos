# Regression is a technique to understand the relationship between 
# the variables and how they contribute.
# often they are related to producing a particular outcome.


# Linear regression  - linear variables

# Single Variable Linear Regression is a technique used to model
# the relationship between a single input independent variable 
# and an output dependent variable using a linear model i.e a line.
# Y=mX+c
# Multi Variable Linear Regression where a model is created for the 
# relationship between multiple independent input variables 
# and an output dependent variable. 
# Y=a_1*X1+a_2*X2+c

# python is slower in execution


# numpy fastens python operations by converting repetative code to
